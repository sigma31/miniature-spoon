**Description of Virus**  
Viruses behave like landmines which are triggered whenver a student comes within range of the Virus. Viruses cause students to lose antibodies at a faster rate dependent on their virulence. Viruses only lose energy when they move i.e when the student moves. Viruses are visible while alive and only become invisible when they die.  

**Description of Hospital**  
Hospital is a class added by me that functions similarly to other buildings. Hospitals provide two purposes- they can be used to cure a student of a virus or they can be used to boost antibodies(doubles current number of antibodies).
